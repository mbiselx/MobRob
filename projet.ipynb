It could have been possible to detect the edges of the outer rectangle defining the map, fill it (meaning put all the pixels inside its border to one), next erode the image to delete all exterieur components to the rectangle, our region of interest. Then we just have to dilate again to have only a big rectangle of white pixels on a black background, which is very easy to detect. But our backround had too much long lines throughout the whole image (for example foots of the table) then filling closed borders would have lead to fill the entire image. To summarize, this is not a good method because our region of interest does not produce the biggest closed border.\n",
    "- convolve the image with a corner (two small lines 90 degrees to each others) has the advantage of being quite scale invariant but depends on rotation. The results were very bad as the image often presents orientations. Furthemore with image with grid pattern we can't distinguish all the corners.\n",
    "- convolve with a disk has the advantage of being rotation invariant, which is better than scale invariant. So we introduced specific patterns at the corners to inderictly detect them. Its better to have disk with specific color, but even then convolution was not good enough (with perspective, disk become ellipsoids and are not detected at all).\n",
    "-use the HSV (Hue Saturation Value) representation of the image to easily detect colors. We pass from RGB representation where it's hard to detect specific colors to the HSV where saturated colors (meaning very red, very blue or very green) are easy to detect on a neutral backgound. Therefore we just need colors, without specific shape. We kept the disks because they are more robust to bad detection : when some pixels are not detect they mostly stay as one connected region of pixels with the same centroid.\n",

    "The local navigation is programmed with Aseba and is thus running on the Thymio itself. This allows a quick reaction to local obstacles, because the data must not to travel to the computer and back.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the local navigation is to follow alongside the obstacle until the robot is back onto its global path.\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow the obstacle, mainly the outer infrared (IR) sensors of the Thymio are used, because they are the only sensors that return non-zero values when the Thymio is parallel to the obstacle. Furthermore, only the speed of the wheel which is further away from the obstacle is usually changed. The speed of the wheel which is closer to the obstacle is mostly constant. An exception is made when at least one of the three middle IR sensors returns a non-zero value, which means that the robot is not parallel to the obstacle anymore. In this case the speed of both wheels are reduced, to avoid a collision with the obstacle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The speed of the wheel which is further away from the obstacle is controlled by a simple proportional controller. This means that the speed of this wheel is proportional to the error (difference between the desired sensor value and the real sensor value). \n",
    "\n",
    "In Aseba, a timer emits an event every 200ms. At each of these events the speed of the closer wheel to the wall is updated, in order to avoid the obstacles. To determine the speeds of the two wheels, first it is determined if the obstacle is located on the left or right side of the robot. Then the speeds are calculated based on the sensor values and the proportional gain. Finally the speed target values of the Thymio are updated with the calculated speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python and the Aseba programs have to communicate with each other, to prevent that both programs interfere with each other by giving contradictory commands. For this purpose the \"event.args\" variables, which are available for both programs, where used. The variable \"event.args[0]\" describes if the robot is in global or local navigation. This considered by both, Python and Aseba, such that only one program gives commands to the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "To switch from global to local navigation, \"event.args[0]\" is changed in Aseba, if a local obstacle is detected with the IR sensors. Furthermore, the flag “event.args[0]” determines if the Python or the Aseba program controls the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a bit harder to switch from global to local navigation. As seen in the course there are multiple solutions to this problem. The chosen solution consists of exiting local navigation if the robot gets back to the global path, as mentioned above. \n",
    "Since the global path is described by close points, the robot can be considered to be on the global path, if it is next to such a point. In this case the robot can continue with the global navigation, but it has to ignore the IR sensors for a moment to avoid getting back into local navigation instantly. However, then the possibility exists that the robot collides with the obstacle while ignoring the IR sensors. The solution implemented to solve this issue, is to assure that the next point of the global navigation and the obstacle are on opposite sides of the robot. This way the robot can exit the local navigation without hitting the obstacle. \n",
    "\n",
    "A challenge encountered during the implementation of the local navigation was the robot turning early around the corner and bumping into it with its rear part. This is because the IR sensors are directed forward and that one wheel has a constant speed. The solution implemented to solve this problem is to delay the turning, when the obstacle is not detected by the sensors anymore. This is not an ideal solution but it is functional."
