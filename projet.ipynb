    "The environment consists of a table with a checkerboard pattern (each square is 200mm x 200mm). The table has blue circles in all corners. A green circle representing the goal position, black geometric shapes representing the obstacles and a Thymio robot are located within the rectangle spanned by the blue circles. Two red circles of different diameters are located on top of the Thymio.\n",

Therefore we want to search four points, which we willingly place at known distances and angles from each other, to standardize our image. \n",

    "We want to get rid off all the random components introduced by taking a picture. it's include translations, rotations, scaling and most importantly perspective transformations. Therefore we want to search four points, which we willingly place at known distances and angles from each other, to standardize our image. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best is to detect the four extreme angles of the rectangle environment. It's increases the precision of the transformation by decreasing the relative error on their distance to each other. There are several ways to find these corners : \n",
    "\n",
    "- detect the lines of the rectangle (hough transform or edge detection) but there will be to many line with obstacles. It could have been possible to detect the edges of the outer rectangle defining the map, fill the obtain rectangle (meaning put all the pixels inside its closed borders to one), next erode the image to delete all exterieur components to the rectangle, our region of interest. Then we just have to dilate to have only the rectangle with its original size on a black background, which is very easy to detect. But our backround has too much long lines throughout the whole image (for example foots of the table) then filling closed borders would have lead to fill most of the image. To summarize, this is not a good method because our region of interest does not produce the biggest closed border, it's included in other closed borders.\n",
    "- convolve the image with a corner (two small lines 90 degrees to each others) has the advantage of being quite scale invariant but depends on rotation. The results were very bad as the image often presents orientations. Furthemore with image with grid pattern we can't distinguish all the corners.\n",
    "- convolve with a disk has the advantage of being rotation invariant, which is better than scale invariant. So we introduced specific patterns at the corners to inderictly detect them. Its better to have disk with specific color, but even then convolution was not good enough (with perspective, disk become ellipsoids and does notfit the pattern anymore).\n",
    "-use the HSV (Hue Saturation Value) representation of the image to easily detect colors. We pass from RGB representation where it's hard to detect specific colors to the HSV where saturated colors (meaning very red, very blue or very green) are easy to detect on a neutral backgound. Therefore we just need colors, without specific shape. We kept the disks because they are more robust to bad detection : when some pixels are not detect they mostly stay as one connected region of pixels with the same centroid.\n",
    "We chose the last option, the most efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore four blue disks are placed next to the four corners, we filter those blue colors of the image and we obtain a mask which is one for each of those blue pixels and zero four the others. We apply an erosion followed by a dilation of the same size to remove all the possibles noisy isolated pixels which could have been sonsidered as blue. In fact if our selection of pixels is too restrictive we might not detect the disks and if it's too large we might detect unexpected regions as blue. Next We apply a labeling of connected components. Meaning that we associate a unique value to each region of pixels which are linked to each others. We ideally want five labels : one for the backround and one for each corners. But even with erosion there might be some unexpected one values in the mask. Therefore we sort all the labels with respect to their number of pixels and we take the four biggest. After that we comput the centroïdes of those four regions. We put also all the blue pixels to white in order to avoid to detect them again in the others functions. Finally we apply the opencv function \"cv2.getPerspectiveTransform\" to fit the detected corners to defined values : the corners of an image of size (1200, 800). We obtain the following image :\n",

    "We apply a similar operation to find the goal. We go through the HSV representation of the obtained map and filter the red components. We sort the labels by the number of elements and from here the function is different. We take the centroid of the biggest label, in term of number of pixels, as the robot position in (x,y) coordinate and we use the centroid of the second biggest label, again in term of number of pixels, to compute the robot's angle.\n",

We binarize the image using a fixed value. Theorically Otsu method is supposed to work better as it maximizes interclass variance end minimising intraclass variance. But for our case a fixed threshold was enough and even a bit better. We use this binary image to find the global path.\n",

    "## Different Approaches\n",
    "Different approaches exist to find an optimal global path. In the beginning a visibility graph was considered. To find the shortest path from start to goal Dijkstra’s algorithm was used. Due to difficulties in detecting the corners of the objects a new approach had to be found. \n",

    "\n",
    "### A* on grid array\n",
    "To find the optimal path from the start to end position, the A* algorithm is used on a binary grid array. The A* algorithm can be seen as an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm. The grid array represents free spaces with a zero and obstacles (which the robot has to navigate around) with a one. For the implementation, a modified version of the code from the Exercise session 5 of the course MICRO-452 “Basics of Mobile Robotics” was used. The code can be found in the [PathPlanning](src/PathPlanning.py) module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A* algorithm theory\n",
    "The A* algorithm combines a motion cost with a heuristic cost. The motion cost and the heuristic function assign a cost to each cell of the array. The motion cost corresponds to the shortest number of steps from the start position to the given cell (obstacles are avoided). \n",
    "The heuristic cost implemented in this case corresponds to the shortest number of steps from the goal position to the given cell (obstacles are not avoided). The final cost for every cell is calculated by adding the corresponding motion and heuristic cost together. To find the optimal path one has to progress step by step to the next adjacent cell with the lowest final cost, starting from the start position until the goal is reached (see fig X1).\n",
    "Note, that the motion and final cost are not calculated for every cell. The algorithm only calculates the cost for “promising” cells (see fig X2).  \n",

    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, the robot has access to several sensors which give it information about the world surrounding it. \n",
    "In our application, the sensors available to us do not allow a reversible mapping into state-space (i.e: the sensor function $\\mathbf y = h(\\mathbf x)$ is non-invertible). This is because the map is made up of a repeating grid, so we have no information on the absolute localization, and furthermore from the pont of view of the sensor, there is no way to tell whether the detected line is horizontal or vertical.\n",
    "We must therefore do a preprocessing step on the raw sensor values to put them into a useable form for our (over)extended Kalman estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "A first approach was, whenever a line was detected by a sensor to simply take the coordinate of the closest gridline to the estimated position of that sensor as the \"measured value\" $\\tilde{\\mathbf y}$. This approach however does not take into account the fact that the estimated postion of the robot can be quite uncertain, so the returned \"measured values\" are very often wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "A different approach is to incorporate our estimated uncertainty into the sensor interpretation. Instead of looking for the closest gridline, we look for the most likely coordinates in which we could encounter a gridline, as shown in figure 3 below. These are then taken as $\\tilde{\\mathbf y}$.\n",

    "The local navigation is programmed with Aseba and is thus running on the Thymio itself. This allows a quick reaction to local obstacles, because the data must not to travel to the computer and back.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the local navigation is to follow alongside the obstacle until the robot is back onto its global path.\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow the obstacle, mainly the outer infrared (IR) sensors of the Thymio are used, because they are the only sensors that return non-zero values when the Thymio is parallel to the obstacle. Furthermore, only the speed of the wheel which is further away from the obstacle is usually changed. The speed of the wheel which is closer to the obstacle is mostly constant. An exception is made when at least one of the three middle IR sensors returns a non-zero value, which means that the robot is not parallel to the obstacle anymore. In this case the speed of both wheels are reduced, to avoid a collision with the obstacle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The speed of the wheel which is further away from the obstacle is controlled by a simple proportional controller. This means that the speed of this wheel is proportional to the error (difference between the desired sensor value and the real sensor value). \n",
    "\n",
    "In Aseba, a timer emits an event every 200ms. At each of these events the speed of the closer wheel to the wall is updated, in order to avoid the obstacles. To determine the speeds of the two wheels, first it is determined if the obstacle is located on the left or right side of the robot. Then the speeds are calculated based on the sensor values and the proportional gain. Finally the speed target values of the Thymio are updated with the calculated speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python and the Aseba programs have to communicate with each other, to prevent that both programs interfere with each other by giving contradictory commands. For this purpose the \"event.args\" variables, which are available for both programs, where used. The variable \"event.args[0]\" describes if the robot is in global or local navigation. This considered by both, Python and Aseba, such that only one program gives commands to the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "To switch from global to local navigation, \"event.args[0]\" is changed in Aseba, if a local obstacle is detected with the IR sensors. Furthermore, the flag “event.args[0]” determines if the Python or the Aseba program controls the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a bit harder to switch from global to local navigation. As seen in the course there are multiple solutions to this problem. The chosen solution consists of exiting local navigation if the robot gets back to the global path, as mentioned above. \n",
    "Since the global path is described by close points, the robot can be considered to be on the global path, if it is next to such a point. In this case the robot can continue with the global navigation, but it has to ignore the IR sensors for a moment to avoid getting back into local navigation instantly. However, then the possibility exists that the robot collides with the obstacle while ignoring the IR sensors. The solution implemented to solve this issue, is to assure that the next point of the global navigation and the obstacle are on opposite sides of the robot. This way the robot can exit the local navigation without hitting the obstacle. \n",
    "\n",
    "A challenge encountered during the implementation of the local navigation was the robot turning early around the corner and bumping into it with its rear part. This is because the IR sensors are directed forward and that one wheel has a constant speed. The solution implemented to solve this problem is to delay the turning, when the obstacle is not detected by the sensors anymore. This is not an ideal solution but it is functional."
