    "The objective of this project is to create a program in Python/Aseba that:\n",
    "- Uses the visual feedback of a webcam to detect the starting position of a robot, its goal position and 2D obstacles in a given environment with some known specifications described in the following section Environment.\n",
    "- Finds the optimal path from the start position of the robot to its goal between the globals obstacles. It uses A* algorithm.\n",
    "- Controls the robot to follow the optimal path, by successively applying filters to estimate its position. The entries are the absolute position of the robot given by the camera, the odometry and proximity and black and white sensors underneath the robot.\n",
    "- Navigates around 3D local obstacles using local avoidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment\n",
    "The environment consists of a white table with a thin grid pattern (each square is 200mm x 200mm). The table has blue disks in all corners. The Thymio robot is located within the rectangle spanned by the blue circles, along with a green disk that represents the goal position and black shapes which represent the obstacles. Two red disks of different diameters are located on top of the Thymio. The global obstacles are in 2D because 3D obstacles with an non vertical view (and even whith such a view) changes a lot in size. For local avoidance we use white 3D obstacles, that are not seen by the vision module.\n",

    "# Image Processing\n",
    "## Detecting corner of the robot's environment\n",
    "We want to get rid off all the random components introduced by taking a picture at a skewed angle. This includes translations, rotations, scaling and most importantly perspective transformations. Therefore we want to search for four points, which we willingly place at known distances and angles from each other, to standardize our image. \n",

    "\n",
    "> *Figure 2: Here is an example of the image we are working with.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## The image processing can be divided into four steps :\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Obtain an image of the region of interest : the map of the environment.\n",
    "The best is to detect the four extreme angles of the rectangle environment. It's increases the precision of the transformation by decreasing the relative error on their distance to each other. There are several ways to find these corners : \n",
    "\n",
    "- detect the lines of the rectangle (hough transform or edge detection) but there will be too many lines with obstacles. It could have been possible to detect the edges of the outer rectangle defining the map, fill the obtained rectangle (meaning put all the pixels inside its closed borders to one), next erode the image to delete all exterior components to the rectangle, our region of interest. Then we just have to dilate to have only the rectangle with its original size on a black background, which is very easy to detect. But our background has too many long lines throughout the whole image (for example legs of the table) then filling closed borders would have lead to filling most of the image. To summarize, this is not a good method because our region of interest does not produce the biggest closed border, it's included in other closed borders.\n",
    "- convolve the image with a corner (two small lines 90 degrees to each others) has the advantage of being quite scale invariant but depends on rotation. The results were very bad as the image often presents rotations. Furthermore with the image with grid pattern we can't distinguish all the corners.\n",
    "- convolve with a disk has the advantage of being rotation invariant, which is better than scale invariant. So we introduce specific patterns at the corners to indirectly detect them. Its better to have disk with specific color, but even then convolution was not good enough (with perspective, disk become ellipsoids and do not fit the pattern anymore).\n",
    "- use the HSV (Hue Saturation Value) representation of the image to easily detect colors. We pass from RGB representation where it's hard to detect specific colors to the HSV where saturated colors (meaning very red, very blue or very green) are easy to detect on a neutral backgound. Therefore we just need colors, without specific shape. We kept the disks because they are more robust to bad detection : when some pixels are not detected they mostly stay as one connected region of pixels with the same centroid.\n",
    "We chose the last option, the most efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore four blue disks are placed next to the four corners, we filter those blue colors of the image and we obtain a mask which is one for each of those blue pixels and zero four the others. We apply an erosion followed by a dilation of the same size to remove all the possibles noisy isolated pixels which could have been considered as blue. In fact if our selection of pixels is too restrictive we might not detect the disks and if it's too large we might detect unexpected regions as blue. Next, we apply a labeling of connected components. Meaning that we associate a unique value to each region of pixels which are linked to each others. We ideally want five labels : one for the background and one for each of the four corners. But even with erosion, there might be some unexpected one values in the mask. Therefore we sort all the labels with respect to their number of pixels and we take the four biggest. After that we compute the centroides of those four regions. We put also all the blue pixels to white in order to avoid to detect them again in the others functions. Finally we apply the opencv function \"cv2.getPerspectiveTransform\" to fit the detected corners to defined values : the corners of an image of size (1200, 800). We obtain the following image :\n",

    "> *Figure 3: This figure shows a map of the robot's environment after transformation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Find the position of the robot.\n",
    "We apply a similar operation to find the robot. We go through the HSV representation of the obtained map and filter the red components. We sort the labels by the number of elements and from here the function is different. We take the centroid of the biggest label, in terms of number of pixels, as the robot position in (x,y) coordinate and we use the centroid of the second biggest label, again in terms of number of pixels, to compute the robot's angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a heuristic correction on the position is applied, to compensate for the effect of the height of the robot and the camera's field of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Find the goal.\n",
    "We again go through the HSV representation, filter green components and compute the centroid of the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Get a map for the global path planning.\n",
    "Here we go from RGB to grayscale representation of the environment. We apply an erosion and dilation to get rid off the line used for local positioning. We binarize the image using a fixed value. Theorically Otsu method is supposed to work better as it maximizes interclass variance end minimising intraclass variance. But for our case, a fixed threshold was enough and even a bit better. We use this binary image to find the global path.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps 1 and 2 are repeated while the robot is moving. We don't really need to do each time the step 1 which recomputes the map but this ensures that even if the camera moves a bit the position of the robot computed in step 2 is still valid. It's a security step. \n",

    "## Different Approaches\n",
    "Different approaches exist to find an optimal global path. In the beginning, the use of a visibility graph was considered. To find the shortest path from start to goal, Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm was applied to the visibility graph. The visibility graph is in fact a fast tool to find the optimal path. But it has some incompatibilities with the image processing part and only provides an advantage in terms of computing speed which is not a critical point, as we only search for the global path only once, at the beginning. It's very easy to produce an occupancy grid, it's a simple binarisation of the grayscale map. But finding corners of obstacles is very difficult and restricted to sharp shapes with acute angles. We could use the Harris corner detector which computes the derivative of the image in several direction but this method often doesn't give the expected number of corners by detecting corners in globally straight but locally sawtooth lines. Computing the convex hull of those points is a good way to reduce their number, but it drastically reduces the possible obstacle shapes to sharp and convex shapes. Therefore the visibility graph has many more drawbacks than advantages (especially given the additionnal computation in image processing might compensate the speed of the visibility graph). We prefered to change to another method.\n",
    "Therefore a cell decomposition/grid based approach was implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A* on grid array\n",
    "To find the optimal path from the start to end position, the A* algorithm is used on a binary grid array (occupancy grid). The A* algorithm can be seen as an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm. The grid array represents free spaces with a zero and obstacles (which the robot has to navigate around) with a one. For the implementation, a modified version of the code from the Exercise session 5 of the course MICRO-452 ‚ÄúBasics of Mobile Robotics‚Äù was used. The code can be found in the [PathPlanning](src/PathPlanning.py) module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A* algorithm theory\n",
    "The A* algorithm combines a motion cost with a heuristic cost. The motion cost and the heuristic function assign a cost to each cell of the array. The motion cost corresponds to the shortest number of steps from the start position to the given cell (obstacles are avoided). \n",
    "The heuristic cost implemented in this case corresponds to the distance between the goal position and the cell (obstacles are not avoided). The final cost for every cell is calculated by adding the corresponding motion and heuristic cost together. To find the optimal path one has to progress step by step to the next adjacent cell with the lowest final cost, starting from the start position until the goal is reached (see fig 5).\n",
    "Note that the motion and final cost are not calculated for every cell. The algorithm only calculates the cost for ‚Äúpromising‚Äù cells (see fig 6).  \n",

    "In our application, most of the sensors available to us do not allow a reversible mapping into state-space (i.e: the sensor function $\\mathbf y = h(\\mathbf x)$ is non-invertible). This is because the map is made up of a repeating grid, so we have no information on the absolute localization (for the IR-sensors). Furthermore, from the point of view of the sensor, there is no way to tell whether the detected line is horizontal or vertical.\n",
    "We must therefore do a preprocessing step on the raw sensor values to put them into a useable form for our (over)extended Kalman estimator.\n",
    "\n",
    "A first approach was, whenever a line was detected by a sensor to simply take the coordinate of the closest gridline to the estimated position of that sensor as the \"measured value\" $\\tilde{\\mathbf y}$. This however does not take into account the fact that the estimated postion of the robot can be quite uncertain, so the returned \"measured values\" were very often wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "A different approach is to incorporate our estimated uncertainty into the sensor interpretation. Instead of looking for the closest gridline, we look for the most likely coordinates in which we could encounter a gridline, as shown in figure 3 below.

    "The local navigation is programmed with Aseba and thus runs on the Thymio itself. This allows a quick reaction to local obstacles, because the data does not travel to the computer and back.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the local navigation is to follow alongside the obstacle until the robot is back onto its global path.\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow the obstacle, mainly the outer infrared (IR) sensors of the Thymio are used, because they are the only sensors that return non-zero values when the Thymio is parallel to the obstacle. Furthermore, only the speed of the wheel which is further away from the obstacle is usually changed. The speed of the wheel which is closer to the obstacle is mostly constant. An exception is made when at least one of the three middle IR sensors returns a non-zero value, which means that the robot is not parallel to the obstacle anymore, but rather perpendicular. In this case the speed of both wheels are reduced, to avoid a collision with the obstacle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The speed of the wheel which is further away from the obstacle is controlled by a simple proportional controller. This means that the speed of this wheel is proportional to the error (difference between the desired sensor value and the real sensor value). \n",
    "\n",
    "In Aseba, a timer emits an event every 200ms. At each of these events, the speed of the wheel closer to the wall is updated, in order to avoid the obstacles. To determine the speeds of the two wheels, first it is determined if the obstacle is located on the left or right side of the robot. Then the speeds are calculated based on the sensor values and the proportional gain. Finally the speed target values of the Thymio are updated with the calculated speeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python and the Aseba programs have to communicate with each other, to prevent that both programs interfere with each other by giving contradictory commands. For this purpose the <code>event.args</code> variables, which are available for both programs, were used. The variable <code>event.args[0]</code> describes if the robot is in global or local navigation. This is considered by both Python and Aseba programs, such that only one program gives commands to the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "To switch from global to local navigation, <code>event.args[0]</code> is changed in Aseba, if a local obstacle is detected with the IR sensors. Furthermore, the flag <code>event.args[0]</code> determines if the Python or the Aseba program controls the robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a bit harder to switch from global to local navigation. As seen in the course there are multiple solutions to this problem. The chosen solution consists of exiting local navigation if the robot gets back to the global path, as mentioned above. \n",
    "Since the global path is described by close points, the robot can be considered to be on the global path, if it is next to such a point. In this case the robot can continue with the global navigation, but it has to ignore the IR sensors for a moment to avoid getting back into local navigation instantly. However, then the possibility exists that the robot collides with the obstacle while ignoring the IR sensors. The solution implemented to solve this issue, is to assure that the end goal and the obstacle are on opposite sides of the robot. This way the robot can exit the local navigation without hitting the obstacle. \n",
    "\n",
    "A challenge encountered during the implementation of the local navigation was the robot turning early around the corner and bumping into it with its rear part. This is because the IR sensors are directed forward and that one wheel has a constant speed. The solution implemented to solve this problem is to delay the turning, when the obstacle is not detected by the sensors anymore. This is not an ideal solution but it is functional.\n",

There are still failures in localising the robot : in hindsight, the red color wasn't such a good choice due to the red LEDs on the robot. There are also some uncertainties due the light (intensity and color) and shadows. In general some robustness steps have been implemented, but the speed of the algorithm could be much better. We aimed for a robust rather than a fast method."

But the implemented A* algorithm uses a not negligible amount of time and storage space to fulfill this task. Nevertheless the A* algorithm seems to be sufficient for our task, because it is only executed once in the beginning of the experiment."

    "\n",
    "To get the local navigation to work, the parameters had to be tweaked which lead to extensive testing. The hand-off between Python and Aseba did not work well at first. However, after letting the robot get out of the local obstacle avoidance mode only if the obstacle was not between the robot and the goal, the switching between local and global navigation was successful. Differences in lighting conditions for different group members meant that the robot would sometimes get too close to the obstacle. Thus the robot would bump into the obstacle. The solution of this issue was to adjust the parameters. \n",
